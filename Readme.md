# Project 2:
## Horror films

##### The initial page will send you to a home screen where you will need to locate the hidden button in the middle of the screen that will then grant you access to the library of horror films.

## User Story

##### The general idea of my app/project is to give the user a list of several top rated horror movies where it is available to stream, full synopsis of said film, personal review, page for the trailer of said film and the duration of the film.
##### The Show page will hold the main film's title picture in the forefront with the synopsis, personal review, link to trailer and where you'd be able to stream it.
##### There will be an edit page, but only to change the reviews, synopsis or where its streamable and even delete a desired film, although in order to delete said film the user must be signed in to do so.
##### The New/Create page will look similar to the edit page. Here you will have the ability to create a new film title with all the properties on the show page, but in order to create a new movie in the database or home screen a name for the movie is required.
##### Specifically on the index page alone will be a seed file and you will have all the titles that will have a show page for. The Nav bar, that will be available throughout all pages, will have links to the index page.


## Wire Frame
![This is an image](https://media.git.generalassemb.ly/user/39136/files/48ea4a80-7210-11ec-8d38-6dcd44c5c39d)
##### This is originally how I intended to have the app and all the corresponding routes to look like.

## MVP Goals
##### To have a full CRUD app using all "RESTFUL" routes


## Stretch Goals
##### Some stretch goals were mostly be css related. I wanted to see if its possible if once the user hovers over the Title of the movie on the show page a short clip of the trailer will play. Otherwise I will make it where the image itself is the link for the trailer.
